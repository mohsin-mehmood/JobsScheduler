# JobsScheduler
A sample project for ordering a set of input jobs taking into account some jobs needs to be done before other jobs. Kahn algorithm is used for topological sorting of Direct Acyclic Graph where each job is represented as a node. An edge from job "a" to job "b" represents that job "a" needs to be completed before job "b"
